# AI-Assisted Development Prompts

This document contains the strategic AI prompts used during development of this Cloudflare AI Agent project. As an experienced software engineering student, I leveraged AI assistance to accelerate development in unfamiliar domains while maintaining architectural control.

## Project Architecture & Planning

"Analyze the technical requirements for building an AI agent on Cloudflare infrastructure with LLM integration, workflow coordination, dual input methods, and persistent state. What's the estimated development timeline?"

## Platform-Specific Implementation

"Wrangler deployment fails with missing entry-point error despite correct wrangler.jsonc configuration. Diagnose the build process."

"Resolve TypeScript errors for Cloudflare Workers environment types and Agents SDK API surface."

## Feature Implementation

"Implement Web Speech API with proper TypeScript types, error handling, and React integration for voice input functionality."

"Design voice input component that integrates seamlessly with existing chat interface without disrupting user flow."

"Create real-time workflow status component to demonstrate Durable Objects coordination and multi-step processing."

"Implement persistent conversation memory using Durable Objects with proper state synchronization across WebSocket connections."

## Performance & Production Optimization

"Optimize local development setup for Cloudflare Workers with hot reload and efficient debugging capabilities."

"Configure production environment with proper secret management and deployment validation."

"Implement error recovery for speech recognition failures, API timeouts, and network issues."

## Documentation & Submission Standards

"Structure README.md with clear architecture overview, setup instructions, and feature demonstrations for technical evaluation."

"Ensure all assignment requirements are demonstrably met with proper evidence and testing instructions."
